## General Tips

### For Best Transcription Quality
1. **Clear Audio**: Ensure minimal background noise
2. **Single Speaker**: Works best with one speaker at a time
3. **Good Microphone**: Higher quality input = better transcription
4. **Moderate Pace**: Clear, well-paced speech transcribes better

### For Multiple Speakers
- Process each speaker's segments separately if possible
- Include speaker names in the metadata
- Consider using timestamps in the source field

### For Technical Content
- Be prepared for technical terms to be transcribed phonetically
- Review transcription before storing
- Consider adding corrections in metadata

### For Long Audio Files
- Always enable "Split long audio"
- Process in smaller segments if transcription fails
- Be patient - long files take time

### Privacy & Security
- Remember: Audio is sent to Google for transcription
- Don't process confidential information without review
- Consider local transcription solutions for sensitive content

### Collection Organization
- Use consistent naming: `type_timeperiod` (e.g., `meetings_2025_q1`)
- Group related content together
- Create separate collections for different clients/projects
- Use metadata fields extensively for better filtering
